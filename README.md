# Blazer Six Image Widget #

An easy to use image widget utilizing the new media manager in WordPress 3.5. It may look simple, but there are plenty of opportunities to modify its behavior via the various hooks already built in. It's a beta concept based on a beta version of WordPress, so things are bound to change.

Feel free to get in touch if you have any feedback or would like to contribute.
